# crypto-browserify-esm

This is an alternative of the original [crypto-browserify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-browserify) but build with ES module rather than commonjs, which means it can be tree-shaked to reduce size.

We patched some source code inside node_modules for building, so we include node_modules in git.
